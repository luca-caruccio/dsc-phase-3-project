### Pump it up data competition, Analyzing water well functionality in Tanzania


## Overview

This project is an attempt at an open sourced competition to best analyze and predict water well functionality in Tanzania. This could also include suggestions at infrastructure changes, geographical decisions, and population focuses.

Unfortunately, our predictive model failed (scored lower than the percentage of funtional wells), however we still had the opportunity to look at some of the challenges the Tanzanian government and, more specifically, the Ministry of Water, is facing. Well functionality seems to have a drop off with higher populations, which is unsurprising.

## Business Problem(s)

The problem is, of course, access to safe and reliable drinking water. Quite literally a matter of life and death, the correct analyzation of which would be invaluable. Population growth, and a less and less wells being buily while more and more break all could spell disaster for Tanzania if not properly addressed and responded to.

## Data and Methods

The data used for this project was generously provided by the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, as well as Taarifa, an open sourced infrastructure assisting to bring water as well as awareness to the nation of Tanzania. The data covers 60,000 water wells across the country, their status (functional versus non-functional) as well as other data such as source types, age, and those responsible for it's installation. This is a ternary problem, and so there are multiple data sets to cross examine.

## Results and Conclusions

Our predictive model unfortunately failed, as such both our results and conclusions are limited at best, and speculative at worst. We can with some certainty say that densely populated areas require more maintenance, however beyond that it would be irresponsible to use this data analysis to warrant any action. Our model clocked in at a score 0.442, lower still than the number of functioning water wells and pumps in Tanzania, effectively meaning that guessing would be a statistically better choice than using this model. 

The conclusions drawn are more or less common sense factors, including additional well maintenance, focus on more densely populated areas (where wells break or run dry more frequently), and exploring alternative or supplemental methods to give citizens access to safe drinking water. 


## Future work

As far as future work goes, there is still much to be done. We could cross-examine different well failures, what factors they share, and possibly use that to prevent and predict such events. Additionally, the average lifespan of a well or pump before going dry, which can help planning and creating infrastructure for future projects, and inevitable breaks. Lastly, what the ideal ratio is person:well, as this would save materials from unnecessary overlap, which would be all the more arduous considering how much of the country is currently facing a drought.
